### How did the idea for BioCam come about?

The founding team has experience with MedTech startups. They were working on a way to transmit physiological information from freedivers at different depths without wearing any equipment. It was during this project that one of the founders, Prof. Marek Langner, recommended modifying existing endoscopic capsules for the purpose. This lead to the founding team analyzing the endoscopic capsule market, and deciding the space was ripe for disruption.

> Seeing how expensive and niche this medical sector is, we decided it was worth changing and popularizing the entire technology of endoscopic capsules, relying on cheaper production costs and artificial intelligence algorithms for image analysis. Our key mission is to be a minimally invasive alternative for gastrointestinal screening tests. The basic social problem is that we are tested too late and too rarely, and most gastrointestinal cancers are diagnosed in the last stages of development, which precludes conventional treatment and means a death sentence. People avoid traditional endoscopic examinations due to panic fear, shame, and lack of education about the importance of screening tests

## Business Activities

### What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?

BioCam wants to use their capsule endoscopy technology and software platform to make gastrointestinal observation safer, less invasive, less expensive, and more effective in diagnosing GI disease. 

> Our ultimate ambition is to deliver a new endoscopic capsule-based system for gastrointestinal observation and diagnosis of abnormalities and diseases that is safe and noninvasive, capable of registering/capturing the whole gastrointestinal tract, that can be easily used by patients at home.

### Intended Customers

BioCam wants their products to be used by doctors and veterinarians to replace or supplement traditional GI observation and imaging techniques (e.g. colonoscopy devices). They plan on getting their products into the hands of physicians and veterinarians through licensing agreements with strategic partners, then leveraging the distribution and marketing infrastructure of those partners. 

> Our business model is technology licensing to corporations from the medical devices, pharmaceutical, consumer electronics, and insurance industry. This allows us to use their sales, distribution and marketing channels as well as brand awareness.
> However, we do not close ourselves to large distribution contracts with a network of clinics and medical facilities.

### Market Size for Traditional Colonoscopy Tools and Capsule Endoscopy

BioCam will be a competitor in both the capsule endoscopy and traditional colonoscopy tool spaces. This is because some doctors might choose BioCam's methodologies over extant products, meaning it's worth examining the larger colonoscopy tool market as well as the smaller, specific, capsule endoscopy market. In both cases, the markets are quite large.

The colonoscopy devices market had an estimated value of $2.1 Billion in 2023, and is expected to grow to about $2.14 Billion by 2030. 

The capsule endoscopy market, albeit smaller, is still valued at approximately $482 Million in 2022, and is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of about 10% through 2030.

### Why are BioCam's products different? 

BioCam has developed proprietary hardware and software that has several key differences from its direct competitors and incumbent colonoscope manufacturers.

*3 Key Hardware Advantages*

- BioCam's capsule will be able to use infrared light to collect information about the GI tract that is not available by only using traditional visible light sources.
- The architecture of BioCam's capsule allows for further development of features related to detection and treatment of GI illness. One potential use case would be the targeted delivery of medications.
- Design considerations (like battery life) have been taken to allow the entire GI tract to be observed. 

*3 Key Software Advantages*

- AI Based Image Creation: Instead of using 3D cameras that generate images from a graphics card, AI helps fuse together images as they come in from the capsule. The resulting "scene reconstruction" is robust and clear (4x higher resolution than competitors), allowing for better diagnoses.
- AI Based Image Analysis: Using AI for image analysis gives doctors "real-time determination of potential threats". Competitors can require several hours between an imaging procedure and results from the doctor, whereas BioCam's powerful AI software cuts the time down by as much as 90%. 
- Mobile Application: BioCam capsules can be synced to a patient's phone, removing the need for another data receiver device (like a tradtional belt). This also allows the patient to undergo the scan in the comfort of their home.

> ...we have been working on pioneering algorithms for augmentation and morphing – generating images and fusing elements into them based on real data. It is a form of synthetic data, not generated in 3D by graphics cards as in competing solutions, but based on fragments of real images, which then translates into a much higher efficiency of machine learning and interpolation of classes with pathological changes.

## Landscape

### What field is the company in? *BioTech/Medical Devices: Capsule Endoscopy*

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?
    - Increased overall image quality
    - 360 degree imaging vs. end-facing cameras using illumination
    - The ability for capsules to transmit imaging data wirelessly
    - Disposable capsules vs. capsules that must be retrieved from stool

* What are the other major companies in this field?
    - [Pillcam](https://www.medtronic.com/covidien/en-us/products/capsule-endoscopy.html) by Medtronic
    - [CapsoVision](https://capsovision.com/capsocam-plus/) by CapsoCam
    - [ENDOCAPSULE](https://medical.olympusamerica.com/procedure/capsule-endoscopy) by Olympus
    - [MiroCam](https://www.intromedicamerica.com/) by IntroMedic
## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
Proving that non-invasive, in-home, endoscopy is viable will open a market that
competes with traditional endoscopic procedures.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?
    - The principal competitors are publicly listed, therefore they measure success mostly by 
    stock price.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?
    - Compnay has not commercialized yet, so it's not technically on the playing field yet.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
  - Improving on how you can move the camera (i.e. improving upon magnetic manipulation)
  - 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
