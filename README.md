| Prof. Marek Langner, ENG. DSC. | *Co-Founder/Mentor* |  |

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? 
> The last World Cancer Statistics showed that colorectal cancer has become the deadliest cancer in men aged 20–49 years.
> More than 71% of all cancers of the digestive system are diagnosed in the last 2 stages of development, when treatment is no longer possible and that simple means a death sentence. This all leads to our mission behind the BioCam.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
 
| Date | Investor | Round | Amount |
| ---- | -------- | ----- | ------ |
| May 2023 | Level2 Ventures | Seed | €440,000 |
| Dec 2021 | Dawid Ubran | Contribution to Grant | €440,000 |
| Jun 2021 | National Center for Research & Development (Poland) | Grant | €1.2 million |
| Apr 2021 | Marcin Grabski | Bridge | €100,000 |
| May 2020 | LT Capital | Pre-Seed | €250,000 |

> In 2020, the LT Capital fund invested in us in the amount of €250,000 in the pre-seed round.
> In 2021, we had a small bridge round with a private investor for €100,000 and with a well-known entrepreneur and business angel, Dawid Urban, who invested €440,000 in us. Dawid Urban’s investment was used as our own contribution to the implementation of the grant received from the National Center for Research and Development for adapting our technology to completely remote research, including in pandemic conditions. The grant is worth over €1.2 million.
Just a few months ago, we received €440,000 in a seed round from Level2 Ventures.

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
> Our ultimate ambition is to deliver a new endoscopic capsule-based system for gastrointestinal observation and diagnosis of abnormalities and diseases that is safe and noninvasive, capable of registering/capturing the whole gastrointestinal tract, that can be easily used by patients at home.

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
> Our business model is technology licensing to corporations from the medical devices, pharmaceutical, consumer electronics, and insurance industry. This allows us to use their sales, distribution and marketing channels as well as brand awareness.

However, we do not close ourselves to large distribution contracts with a network of clinics and medical facilities.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
    - no belt required to track imaging, you can do it from your phone
    - means clients do not have to buy the recording devices, and they can sell 1 type of capsule,
    instead of 1 capsule per specific disease they are looking for (eg. grohns pill vs generic pill)
    - Not using 3D imaging via graphics card. Instead, fusing computer vision for "scene reconstruction"
    - Cost is about PLN 1,000-1,200, which is half of current capsule endoscopy products in Poland, and on par with existing invasive diagnostics.
    - Entire GI tract from esophagus to intestines.Can spot "neoplastic lesions, polyps, latent bleedings, ulcer diseases and Leśniewski and Crohn’s diseases", which do not require biopsies.

    > ...we have been working on pioneering algorithms for augmentation and morphing – generating images and fusing elements into them based on real data. It is a form of synthetic data, not generated in 3D by graphics cards as in competing solutions, but based on fragments of real images, which then translates into a much higher efficiency of machine learning and interpolation of classes with pathological changes.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

## Landscape

* What field is the company in? BioTech/Medical Devices: Capsule Endoscopy

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?
    - Increased overall image quality
    - 360 degree imaging vs. end-facing cameras using illumination
    - The ability for capsules to transmit imaging data wirelessly
    - Disposable capsules vs. capsules that must be retrieved from stool

* What are the other major companies in this field?
    - [Pillcam](https://www.medtronic.com/covidien/en-us/products/capsule-endoscopy.html) by Medtronic
    - [CapsoVision](https://capsovision.com/capsocam-plus/) by CapsoCam
    - [ENDOCAPSULE](https://medical.olympusamerica.com/procedure/capsule-endoscopy) by Olympus
    - [MiroCam](https://www.intromedicamerica.com/) by IntroMedic
## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
Proving that non-invasive, in-home, endoscopy is viable will open a market that
competes with traditional endoscopic procedures.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?
    - The principal competitors are publicly listed, therefore they measure success mostly by 
    stock price. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?
    - Compnay has not commercialized yet, so it's not technically on the playing field yet.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
  - Improving on how you can move the camera (i.e. improving upon magnetic manipulation)
  - 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
