### How did the idea for BioCam come about?

The founding team has experience with MedTech startups. They were working on a way to transmit physiological information from freedivers at different depths without wearing any equipment. It was during this project that one of the founders, Prof. Marek Langner, recommended modifying existing endoscopic capsules for the purpose. This lead to the founding team analyzing the endoscopic capsule market, and deciding the space was ripe for disruption.

> Seeing how expensive and niche this medical sector is, we decided it was worth changing and popularizing the entire technology of endoscopic capsules, relying on cheaper production costs and artificial intelligence algorithms for image analysis. Our key mission is to be a minimally invasive alternative for gastrointestinal screening tests. The basic social problem is that we are tested too late and too rarely, and most gastrointestinal cancers are diagnosed in the last stages of development, which precludes conventional treatment and means a death sentence. People avoid traditional endoscopic examinations due to panic fear, shame, and lack of education about the importance of screening tests

## Business Activities

### What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?

BioCam wants to use their capsule endoscopy technology and software platform to make gastrointestinal observation safer, less invasive, less expensive, and more effective in diagnosing GI disease. 

> Our ultimate ambition is to deliver a new endoscopic capsule-based system for gastrointestinal observation and diagnosis of abnormalities and diseases that is safe and noninvasive, capable of registering/capturing the whole gastrointestinal tract, that can be easily used by patients at home.

### Intended Customers

BioCam wants their products to be used by doctors and veterinarians to replace or supplement traditional GI observation and imaging techniques (e.g. colonoscopy devices). They plan on getting their products into the hands of physicians and veterinarians through licensing agreements with strategic partners, then leveraging the distribution and marketing infrastructure of those partners. 

> Our business model is technology licensing to corporations from the medical devices, pharmaceutical, consumer electronics, and insurance industry. This allows us to use their sales, distribution and marketing channels as well as brand awareness.
> However, we do not close ourselves to large distribution contracts with a network of clinics and medical facilities.

### Market Size for Traditional Colonoscopy Tools and Capsule Endoscopy

BioCam will be a competitor in both the capsule endoscopy and traditional colonoscopy tool spaces. This is because some doctors might choose BioCam's methodologies over extant products, meaning it's worth examining the larger colonoscopy tool market as well as the smaller, specific, capsule endoscopy market. In both cases, the markets are quite large.

The colonoscopy devices market had an estimated value of $2.1 Billion in 2023, and is expected to grow to about $2.14 Billion by 2030. 

The capsule endoscopy market, albeit smaller, is still valued at approximately $482 Million in 2022, and is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of about 10% through 2030.

### Why are BioCam's products different? 

BioCam has developed proprietary hardware and software that has several key differences from its direct competitors and incumbent colonoscope manufacturers.

*3 Key Hardware Advantages*

- BioCam's capsule will be able to use infrared light to collect information about the GI tract that is not available by only using traditional visible light sources.
- The architecture of BioCam's capsule allows for further development of features related to detection and treatment of GI illness. One potential use case would be the targeted delivery of medications.
- Design considerations (like battery life) have been taken to allow the entire GI tract to be observed. 

*3 Key Software Advantages*

- AI Based Image Creation: Instead of using 3D cameras that generate images from a graphics card, AI helps fuse together images as they come in from the capsule. The resulting "scene reconstruction" is robust and clear (4x higher resolution than competitors), allowing for better diagnoses.
- AI Based Image Analysis: Using AI for image analysis gives doctors "real-time determination of potential threats". Competitors can require several hours between an imaging procedure and results from the doctor, whereas BioCam's powerful AI software cuts the time down by as much as 90%. The implementation of AI represents, by far, the biggest competitive advantage for BioCam.
- Mobile Application: BioCam capsules can be synced to a patient's phone, removing the need for another data receiver device (like a tradtional belt). This also allows the patient to undergo the scan in the comfort of their home.

> ...we have been working on pioneering algorithms for augmentation and morphing – generating images and fusing elements into them based on real data. It is a form of synthetic data, not generated in 3D by graphics cards as in competing solutions, but based on fragments of real images, which then translates into a much higher efficiency of machine learning and interpolation of classes with pathological changes.

*Maciej Wysocki - [source article](https://ain.capital/2023/08/01/startup-of-the-day-polish-medtech-biocam/)*

### Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?

BioCam makes specific mention of using machine learning, specifically neural networks, to identify "images with potential pathologies". They used data from Kvasir-Capsule in order to start training their model, and acknowledge that there is still a great deal of work to do in order to fully train their models. 

NBI (Narrow Band Imaging) technology allows BioCam capsule to create contrast between different types of tissue or structures within the body. By filtering and detecting specific light wavelengths, the resulting images can, for example, show thin capillaries in the intestines as brown and highlight blue the thicker blood vessels. This additional contrast helps the accuracy of any observations and diagnoses. 

## Landscape

### What field is the company in?

It's possible to label what BioCam is doing under Medical Devices, Medical Software, BioTech, etc. The most specific classification would be Capsule Endoscopy. 

### What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?

The trends in capsule endoscopy and colonoscopy devices have been driven by major increases in demand. Sadly, colorectal cancer, Crohn's disease, and other gastrointestinal illnesses have been on the rise worldwide. This fact, in combination with advances in technology across other sectors (particularly in optics and software), have lead to the following examples of innovation within capsule endoscopy:

- Increased overall image quality from higher resolution cameras
- 360 degree imaging
- The ability for capsules to transmit imaging data wirelessly (and now to the cloud)
- Disposable capsules vs. capsules that must be retrieved from stool

These advances have lead to overall improvements in patient comfort and diagnostic accuracy.

### What are the other major companies in this field?

A sector with this level of economic and medical significance will always have big players. Here are the top incumbent firms/products in the capsule endoscopy space.

## Results

### What has been the business impact of this company so far?

Although the company has not gone to market yet, their ability to raise the necessary funds for R&D, and their acceptance into Google's "Growth Academy: AI for Health" program, validate the assumptions that there is a need for AI-driven non-invasive, in-home, endoscopy. This validation will certainly affect the near-term plans of all incumbent firms.

### What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success?

Many of the competitors are publicly listed, so they are highly scrutinized for stock valuations, sales growth, cost management, and other economic factors. On the technical side, they also track resolution of images produced, how much of the GI tract can be imaged and time between imaging and medical analysis. 

### How is your company performing based on these metrics?

BioCam has not yet started its commercialization, therefore it's not a fair assessment to compare BioCam's sales metrics with those of the incumbent firms. It is anticipated that BioCam will cost significantly less that current capsule endoscopy treaments, which should positively impact sales.

However, so far BioCam is demonstrating superiority when it comes to technical aspects like image resolution, % of the GI tract imaged (100% for BioCam), and time between imaging and medical analysis. The competitors lack an AI element, and don't have to measure the accuracy of the model, cost of R&D, etc., which will be markers that are closely tracked by BioCam.

BioCam has currently dedicated itself to at least 200 patient volunteer triails, and is avertising a 97% accuracy of it's models identifying problematic images. The next major milestone will be FDA and clinical approval by the relevant authorities in the US and Europe. 

### How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?

Although there are not really any commercial measurements to assess, it is highlyl impressive that BioCam has demonstrated the ability to integrate AI into its software at a reliable enough level to conduct clinical trials and seek FDA approval. Already this sets it apart from the competition, and sets the company up to redefine the capsule endoscopy space. As noted above, BioCam is outperforming the competition by key technical measures.

The competitors are likely concerned by BioCam's technical superiority and lower price.

## Recommendations

### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

If BioCam's AI driven diagnostic software is as accurate as they expect it to be, I would advise the company to do the following:

- Teach the AI model to include detection of intra-abdominal abscesses and potential obstruction causing adhesions for patients following abdominal surgery.
- Create an API that would allow device manufacturers/developers to run their images through the diagnostic tool, alerting doctors to potentially life threatening abscesses or adhesions that could have been missed.
- Improve the existing optics and image construction technology for tools exploring the areas around the intestines, just as they have for within the intestines.

### Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

These changes would give BioCam access to an entirely new market that could be just as ready for disruption as capsule endoscopy. Laproscopes are likely subject to similar limitations that colonoscopy tools suffer from. Also, these changes would leverage the diagnostic advances made by BioCam and not require creating a brand new set of diagnostic mechanisms from scratch.

Creating the API would allow BioCam to monetize their software products without necessarily needing to go down the hardware route. 

In both cases, there would be potentially massive benefits to patient health and overall care for post-op patients.

### What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

These additional services would add to the existing neural network driven tools already being produced by BioCam. There will be much more data available to BioCam for training the model in additional diagnoses.

The API would also leverage the existing software architecture being used by BioCam. 

### Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

These technologies are appropriate, because they are already being used by the company. Additionally, the results of these changes would be in line with the company's objectives of providing more comfortable, affordable, accurate, and safe care for patients.
