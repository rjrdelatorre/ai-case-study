Hello,

My name is Rolando, and I learned about Xilis while researching companies who use AI to improve existing diagnoses and treatments for cancer patients.
Would it be possible to be directed towards any publicly available information on how you used AI in the creation of MOS technology, how AI aids in drug treatment predictions, or any other critical use cases where Xilis uses AI? 
My Aunt's multi-year battle and ultimate survival from breast cancer made it abundantly clear to my family that the work you are doing is critical for improving how we care for the many people suffering from these diseases.
Thank you for the work Xilis is doing, and thank you for any AI information you might be able to share with me that could help with class.

Warm regards,

Rolando
